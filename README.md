##### Problem #####
  Science students are often visual learners. While graphs are often times provided
  in test books, they tend to have to much convoluted information which tend to
  confuse them.
##### Solution #####
  This visualization tool allows students to examine the data by showing
  the entire daily cycle.
  
  May your brain overcome your ego.
